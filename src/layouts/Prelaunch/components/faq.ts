    question: "What is JBLB?",
    answer: `JBLB is the world’s first YieldSport™ — a competitive, gamified staking experience where players stake assets, enter battles, climb leaderboards, and earn yield in real time.

It transforms traditional staking into a dynamic, social, and rewarding sport.`,
  },
  {
    question: "How does YieldSport™ work?",
    answer: `Players participate in short-duration staking battles (30 minutes, 1 hour, 6 hours, 24 hours, and more).

Your performance in each battle determines your rank, and your rank determines your share of the rewards.

Once players stake assets:
- Assets remain locked for a brief cooldown period.
- The JBLB Vault optimizes these pooled assets to generate yield behind the scenes.
- Rewards are distributed instantly at the end of each battle.

YieldSport™ makes staking feel like a game — fast, competitive, and fun.`,
  },
  {
    question: "Is JBLB safe?",
    answer: `Yes. JBLB integrates directly with audited DeFi protocols such as SaucerSwap, leveraging their proven infrastructure.

All staking activity flows through the JBLB Vault, which:
- Manages settlements
- Ensures payout accuracy
- Optimizes asset placement
- Maintains long-term yield sustainability

Your funds remain in secure, transparent, on-chain environments at all times.`,
  },
  {
    question: "What is the JBLB Vault?",
    answer: `The JBLB Vault is the core yield engine that powers YieldSport™.

While battles pay out instantly, all staked assets continue earning yield in the background through strategic exposure to protocols like SaucerSwap.

To sustain rewards, these assets go through a cooldown cycle after each battle, ensuring they stay productive for longer.

The Vault’s role includes:
- Aggregating all staked assets
- Maximizing yield efficiency
- Replenishing battle reward pools
- Providing long-term sustainability for the entire ecosystem

It’s the economic engine that keeps JBLB stable, rewarding, and scalable.`,
